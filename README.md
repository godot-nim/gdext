## Engine supported

- [x] [godotengine/godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) 4.3.0

## Dependencies

* [nim-lang/nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/nim) 2.0.0 or higher
  #### Macos
  Use Nim installed via Homebrew, not choosenim.
  Due to the execution environment of Godot itself, a native AArch64/ARM64 build of Nim is required, and that choosenim installs a x86_64 build emulated via Rosetta.
